\section{Poll}
\subsection{What is your favorite programming language?}
\vspace{0.25in}
\subsection{What do you use to make numerical plots?}
\vspace{0.25in}
\subsection{Do you have a laptop you can bring to class? Is it installed with the above?}

\section{Pennies}

This morning I grabbed 32 pennies on the way to work.  In a minute, I'm going
to toss them on the table and count how many heads ($H$) and tails ($T$) there are.

\subsection{What is $\langle H-T\rangle$ (the expected value of $H-T$)?}
\vspace{0.25in}
\subsection{What is $\langle|H-T|\rangle$?}
\vspace{0.25in}

\section{Dumbells}

I also brought two (light) dumbells in.  A bit later, we are each going to 
twist back and forth while holding them outstretched in our arms at a fixed angular 
frequency, $\omega$.  We are also going to try
standing still and pumping the dumbells alternately toward and away from each other, again
with angular frequency $\omega$.
\subsection{Which do you anticipate feeling harder?}
\vspace{0.25in}
\subsection{If we quantized this system, which do you think would take a larger
energy quantum to start oscillating?}
\vspace{0.25in}
