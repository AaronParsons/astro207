If it is high ($\\tau\\gg1$), then when we see the \"glow\" of the glowstick, we aren't actually seeing all of the light emitted inside of it, we are only seeing a thin shell on the outside, and that would mean we shouldn't have divided out by the whole volume. I'm going to guess that manufacturers don't waste much glow juice; I bet they put just enough to make it nearly optically thick and no more. That's the assumption I've made when I assume we are seeing photons generated from everywhere in the cylinder."
