\section{How does power scale under Lorentz transformations (i.e. versus $\gamma$)?}
\vspace{1.3in}
\section{In the electron's (instantaneous) rest frame, what causes the acceleration that 
gives rise to synchrotron emission in the lab frame?}
\vspace{1.3in}
\section{Draw a picture of the frequency power spectrum of synchrotron emission from a single electron.}
\vspace{1.3in}
\section{Assume electrons are distributed versus energy as $E^p$ with $p$ in the range
described in the video.  Is the scaling of the frequency spectrum versus $\nu$ steeper
or shallower than $p$?  What is the underlying reason for the change in spectral index?}
