You can regard this as a \"deus ex machina\" where the story was cooked up to work (which it was). I like to think that there is a kernel of truth in each step that comes from the fact that QM must reproduce classical mechanics in ensemble on large scales, and QM just acts to make the math more of a headache without fundamentally changing what is going on."
